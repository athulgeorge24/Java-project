#  UniSeat – Universal Smart Seating Arrangement System

A **Java Swing-based Smart Seating Management Application** built using the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern.  
The project helps to **generate, visualize, and manage seating arrangements** in venues such as examination halls, auditoriums, and conferences.



## Overview

The **UniSeat System** simplifies seating management by allowing users to:

* Upload participant lists (simulated `.docx` processing)
* Generate venue layouts (rows × columns)
* Toggle seat availability dynamically
* View real-time statistics: total, available, and occupied seats
* Simulate automatic seating assignment

Built entirely in **Java**, it demonstrates strong use of:
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* Swing GUI Components
* MVC design pattern
