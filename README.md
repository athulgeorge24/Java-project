The UniSeat System is a Java-based smart seating arrangement management application built using the Swing GUI framework.
Its main purpose is to simplify, automate, and visualize the process of creating and managing seat allocations in venues such as:

Examination halls

Auditoriums

Seminar or conference halls

Wedding/event spaces

It allows users to:

Upload participant or student lists (e.g., from a .docx file).

Design venue layouts with a specified number of rows and columns.

View seat status dynamically (available or occupied).

Simulate automatic seat assignment to participants.

Display key statistics such as total, occupied, and available seats.

This system demonstrates principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), GUI design, and the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern â€” separating data (Model), user interface (View), and logic (Controller).
